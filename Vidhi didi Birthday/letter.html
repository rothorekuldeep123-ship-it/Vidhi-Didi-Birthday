    <p>Dear Vidhi Didi,</p>

    <p>
      When we first met, I didn’t really understand you.
      You felt quiet, a little self-centered, egoistic at times,
      and mostly lost in your own world.
      That was my first impression, and honestly,
      I never thought it would change the way it did.
    </p>

    <p>
      But time has a way of revealing people slowly.
      Through conversations, shared moments,
      and even long silences,
      we began to understand each other better.
      Without realizing it, our bond grew deeper and more emotional.
    </p>

    <p>
      There came a moment in my life
      when I needed guidance more than anything.
      I asked you for advice about something
      only the two of us knew.
      I still remember how carefully you listened,
      how calmly you understood,
      and how thoughtfully you guided me.
    </p>

    <p>
      In that moment, you didn’t feel like just someone giving advice.
      You felt like a real elder sister —
      someone who genuinely cared,
      someone who wanted the best for me.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are things I can’t share with my real sister,
      things I keep locked inside.
      But with you, I could open up without fear,
      without hesitation,
      and without being judged.
    </p>

    <p>
      That is what makes you so special to me.
      You are not just a part of my life,
      you are the elder sister I found along the way.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:right; margin-top:40px;">
      — Always grateful
